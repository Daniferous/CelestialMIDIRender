# Meta Disclaimers
Please read the following as it contains meta-information regarding this project.

1. This is a parody of the Aranara MIDI Render Series if it was led by an EA ex-ceo or something. If you actually want to render your MIDIs (with the real Aranara MIDI Render) without the crap this thing has, click [here](https://daniferous.github.io/aranara-midi-player-sb3/) instead. This project is literally identical to Aranara MIDI Render Toolkit Release 1.2 with a ton of transactions. (Lore: I made the code for Aranara MIDI Render Toolkit Release 1.2 public and it so happened that 1.3 and onwards are protected with the Guidelines.)
2. The creator "SolaricZuli" is purely fictional and any resemblance to other people with the same namesake is purely fictional.
3. The shop function does not request real money as it is purely a parody and not meant to profit off of anyone! This is strictly stipulated in the "Rules and Guidelines" section for the usage of Aranara MIDI Player, which can be seen [here](https://daniferous.github.io/aranara-midi-player-sb3/guidelines/). Therefore, if you come across a MIDI Program that looks, feels, and IS the same as either the Celestial MIDI Render or Aranara MIDI Render program that ASKS for any banking information, **[DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY OF THOSE, AND LEAVE/DELETE THAT PROGRAM IMMEDIATELY]()**. Chances are, it would be a scam or may contain bad stuff which I (Dani) am very much against.[^1]
4. Celestial MIDI Render's custom importer is a fork of the AraMIDI conversion tool, with some features "borrowed" from its Faelei branch. For now, I might only provide the executable (since I don't really want to make another branch) available in this repository (as a release!).[^2]
5. The MIDI Format ".celesmidi" contains partial support for CC Events, though a vast majority of those are either visual or technical. Such technical "CC Events" could manipulate the program's code (by only affecting the variables/lists and arbitrarily running Events/Broadcasts), but everything is sandboxed within the Renderer therefore it is safe. If you somehow managed to irreversibly damage Celestial MIDI Render, reload (if on browser) or redownload (if an sb3 file is provided) and everything will be as if nothing had happened.
6. Your progress (AKA your "Celestial Account") **__DOES NOT SAVE__**. Just like with Lost Lurker Game (Beta 1.1), your progress does not persist once you leave, close, or reload the program. I might add a way to save/load progresses (I did at an earlier build, but scrapped it since it would not make sense if Celestial MIDI Render were actually an online service).[^3]
7. Always remember: This is a parody project and is not intended to be taken seriously. It is simply a simulation as to what if a MIDI Rendering Program - One that was either free to use or purchasable at a one-time fee (or a simpler subscription model) - were to function like a Mobile Game: with Advertisements, Terrible In-Program Purchases, etc. And no, the market for MIDI Rendering is very niche and there are an abundance of MIDI Rendering software, so the idea of a "Celestial MIDI Renderer" would probably not be profitable.

### Footnotes

[^1]: Which is ironic, considering that the whole premise of "Celestial MIDI Render" is that it rips you off.

[^2]: It is really just intended terrible coding. This is intended to simulate how the development team has no regard for optimisation, but the general idea that "more is better".

[^3]: ...I probably should work more on Lost Lurker Game more than... this.
